This work is maintained 
by a community of hundreds 
of people and a _massive collaborative effort_ to 
bring the readily  available coding knowledge offline

"Many coders ask me how to improve their own performances
I cannot say anything except
solve and review and prepare 
your library"
-_Uwi Tenpen_

# Maintainers

This is a massive collaboration. Hence, to keep the quality intact and drive the vision in the proper direction, we have maintainers.

> Maintainers are your friends forever. They are vastly different from moderators.

Currently, we have **5 active maintainers** and we are expanding quickly.

The task of maintainers is to review pull requests, suggest further quality additions and keep the work up to date with the current state of the world. üåç

# Contributors

The success of our vision to bring knowledge offline depends on you. Even a small contribution helps. All forms of contributions are highly welcomed and valued.

Currently, we have over **1000+ contributors** in Cosmos and **over 2K+ contributors** in sister projects of Cosmos.

When you contribute, your name with a link (if available) is added to our [contributors list](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/wiki/contributors).

You can contribute by writing `code`, documentation in the form of `installation guides` and `style guides`, making Cosmos search friendly and many others. There are endless possibilities.

Additionally, you might want to take a look at this [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/wiki/contribute) before you make Cosmos better.

You may, also, refer to the available [style guides](/guides/coding_style) before contributing code.
